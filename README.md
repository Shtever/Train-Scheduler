# Train-Scheduler
Optional Homework 9/23


In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a train schedule which pushes user input to firebase and appends the information to a table.

This assignment implemented our comprehension of:
 - Javascript
 - JQuery
 - HTML
 - CSS styling
 - Bootstrap
 - Firebase

This template isn't just for trains - it could be used to track all sorts of stuff....

It could even be used to track employee names, role, and start date.
